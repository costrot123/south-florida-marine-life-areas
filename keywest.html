  <h2> Key West Marine Life </h2>
<p> From colorful coral reefs inhabited by a variety of tropical fish to large Loggerhead Sea turtles, this area near Key West is home to countless of incredible marine species. These animals depend on healthy ecosystems composed of corals, seagrass, mangroves and other habitats in order to maintain their populations. Fortunately, located in Key West, is the third largest coral barrier reef in the world which paired with an abundance of backcountry sand flats support this diverse marine life. Additionally, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, which protects over 2,900 square nautical miles of Key West waters, was established to further protect these ecosystems. Bringing attention to the beauty and importance of Key West’s marine life is one of the many ways to help protect
  these incredible ecosystems </p>

    <p> Known as the “tiger of the flats” the barracuda is a highly intelligent and fast predator. They feed on a variety of fish such as snappers and grouper which allows them to reach sizes between 5 and 30 pounds. An interesting fact about barracudas is that they are attracted to shiny objects, therefore removing your jewelry before going snorkeling can be a good idea.  Although barracudas are predators,
      they generally do not attack humans. <b> Click the picture above to see the barracuda swim. </b> </p>

    <p>The Atlantic Bottlenose Dolphin can be commonly spotted around this Key West area. They breed and feed in the mangroves where the water is shallow. Dolphins usually travel in groups called pods and can be spotted jumping through boat wakes and playing around.

    <p>Unlike the common Maine Lobster, the Spiny Lobster does not have large claws and instead has very long antennas as can be seen in the photo above. Spiny Lobsters make delicious meals, and if you are looking to cook one it is recommended that you eat the abdomen. Since lobster fishing in the Keys is not limited to commercial entities,
      you can go catch one yourself during lobster season! </p>

    <p>The Spotted Eagle Ray is part of the Eagle Ray Family which can be found in the major oceans of the world. Their enlarged winglike pectoral fins allow them to effortlessly and gracefully glide through the water. They usually feed on mollusks and crustaceans inhabiting the sea floor bottom when they are not swimming near the water’s surface.
      The Spotted Eagle Ray can reach a wingspan of 7 feet. </p>
