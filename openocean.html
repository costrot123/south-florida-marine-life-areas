    <h2>Open Ocean Marine Life</h2>
  <p> Beginning about 5 miles off the shore of Florida, this open ocean area is home to a multitude of bigger fish that need large habitats to thrive. Swordfish, Grouper, Wahoo, and varieties of tuna can be found living in this area. Given that many of the fish living in this area are considered prized game fish, much of this marked area is popular for both commercial and private fishing. This open ocean area is much deeper and offers little shelter compared to other ecosystems such as coral reefs or bays resulting in a much different ecosystem. </p>

    <p> Swordfish are large fish characterized by a long, flat upper jaw that appears to resemble a sword. Although they can weigh in up too 1,400 pounds, they are fast and excellent swimmers. Swordfish can usually be found from the surface to 2,000 feet below, and thus must be fished in the open ocean as coastlines are too shallow for swordfish.
      An interesting fact is that swordfish do not have any scales! <span id="additional"> Click here for additional interactive facts! </span>  </p>

    <p id="modal-par">Yellowfin Tuna can be commonly found in this open ocean area, from about 5 to 30 miles off the coast of Florida.  Due to the immense size of its habitat yellowfin tunas can grow quite quickly and reach weights of up to 400 pounds! Similar to other tuna species, yellowfin tuna is considered a delicacy and is eaten across the globe in seafood and sushi dishes. This has unfortunately caused overfishing and contributed to declining population numbers.

    <p>Wahoos live in tropical waters around the world and can be found in multiple locations in Florida. An interesting fact about Wahoos is that they are capable of reaching speeds of up to 60 miles an hour. Valued for its excellent flavor, Wahoo is commonly
      fished in this area and is considered a prized game fish. </p>
